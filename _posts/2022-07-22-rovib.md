1) Calculate the energies from your choice of electronic structure method. Note: High precision is important here. Likely steps:

   - Copy params.dat into make-energies folder
   - Run all structures using `./run-1step.sh`
   - Read the energies with `python read-precise.py |# of structures|  > energy1.dat`
2) Calculate the derivatives in internal coordinates using anpass
   - Copy the energies over to the anpass directory
     - `cp energy1.dat ../anpass`
     - `cd ../anpass`
   - Build and run anpass
     - `./build-anpass.sh`
   - This writes the derivatives (in internal coordinates into fort.9903) but these derivatives need to be sorted before we can use them for the next step. 
      - Sort them using `./sort_fort.sh`
3) We now have the internal coordinates as well as the new geometry written to the file `fort.983`. We need to calculate the new minimum energy geometry.
   - Copy any internal coordinates that are non-zero from `fort.983` and 

4) We will now convert the derivatives in internal coordinates back into Cartesian derivatives using the program Intder. First we will copy over the files needed:
   - `cp sorted_fort.9903 ../spectro`
   - `copy and the geometry from new-geom.log`
   - move to the spectro directory `cd ../spectro`

5) Build the intder input file:
   - `cat intder.header sorted_fort.9903 > intder.in`
   - Open intder.in using vi and paste in your geometry and separate the derivative by type (I will show you how)

6) Run Intder `Intder2005.e <intder.in > intder.out` 

7) Prepare to run Spectro:
   - Paste your geometry file into `spectro.in`
   - Copy derivatives from Intder to Spectro. 
     - `cp file15 fort.15`
     - `cp file20 fort.30`
     - `cp file24 fort.40`

8) Run Spectro: `spectro.x < spectro.in > spectro.out`

9) Process the Spectro output file.

   - Rotational Constants
