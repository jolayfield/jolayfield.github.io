## Astrochemistry
  We study the ro-vibrational structure of molecules with astrochemical significance.  The main thrust of this work is building reparametrized semi-empirical methods to define the vibrational potential energy surface.  
## Phase-Transfer Catalysis

### Physical Transfer
  The transfer of atomic and molecular ions across the imiscible liquid-liquid interfaces involves the dynamics of solute-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions.
